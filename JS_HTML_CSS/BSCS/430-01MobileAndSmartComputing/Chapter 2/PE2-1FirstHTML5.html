            I am reading this book to develop websites that can <br>
            be accessed from any device and can serve as cross-platform <br>
            apps. <br>
            The devices I will test will be running the following systems:
        </p>
        <p>
            Apple iOS <br>
            Google Android <br>
            Blackberry OS <br>
            Microsoft Windows Phone OS <br>
